## Author
Cara McAvinchey 

## Project Overview
*  For fans of Big Bang Theory, this twist on the classic rock, paper, scissors game designed using JavaScript hopes to bring enjoyment to those who would like a 5 minute break whether at home or at work. The fully responsive sight allows users to play against Sheldon Cooper using 'lizard' and 'spock' as additional choices.

## DESIGN CHOICES

### Colors
- The space background image inspired the color palette of the website and links to the theme of the game. 
- The headings and body text are white to ensure clear contrast and readability for the user.
- Background of the header and footer is a light purple to ensure clear contrast and delineation between sections.
- All text and icon elements have a semi-transparent purple background to ensure the text has contrast from the background.
- The icons are orange to add contrast from the purple palette.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

**First time visitor:**
1. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to play the game quickly and learn the rules fast. The rules need to be clear to understand and easy to refer back to.
   1. The welcome area with the menu will allow users to navigate the page quickly and easily as needed.
   2. The rules are displayed both as a visual and infographic grid.
  
**Returning visitor:**
1. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to start playing the game once I load the page with very few clicks. If I forget the rules, I want to be able to refer back to the rules quickly. 
   1. The close and quit buttons will help users navigate between the rules and game area.

### Manual Testing
- You can view manual testing of the website [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I9u6TR5_VShrvwokTrLhI9-OFdkqnsuMuvzmYk1Uw-k/edit?usp=sharing)

### Outstanding Defects
- The footer doesn't remain fixed at the bottom of the site on all screen sizes, this isn't obvious to the user and doesn't clash with other elements. This will be fixed in future debugging.

### Defects of Note
1. The resizing of the game section for smaller screen sizes had many challenges. Flexbox solved most of the issues using media queries.

## ACCESSIBILITY

### Lighthouse Audit
- The deployed website was run through [web.dev measure](https://web.dev/measure/) to check performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO scores.
